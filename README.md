# [Python Programming Excercises](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/PythonProgrammingExercises/tree/main/GitProjects)

* This is a continuation on my daily pratice. I have been using [this](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises%20for%20Python%203.md) repo to pratice my skills, I find the questions to be quite difficult and loce the challenge of solving these. I am including only intermediate and beginner programs because the advanced ones are too difficult for me at this stage. This repo should contain anywhere from 75-100 programs.
