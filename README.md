# [Python Programming Excercises](https://github.com/Darrenrodricks/PythonProgrammingExercises/tree/main/GitProjects)

* This is a continuation on my daily pratice. I have been using [this](https://github.com/zhiwehu/Python-programming-exercises/blob/master/100%2B%20Python%20challenging%20programming%20exercises%20for%20Python%203.md) repo to pratice my skills, I find the questions to be quite difficult and loce the challenge of solving these. I am including only intermediate and beginner programs because the advanced ones are too difficult for me at this stage. This was another great step in my journey to master python, despite not unnderstanding a few of the questions due to difficulty, this repo helped me practice topics that I have not done in a while. This was a great help to me practicing concepts such as List comprehension, indexing elements, pratice using generators, building small classs and understanding OOP better.  This repo overall was a great help and will defineltey be going back and attempting the more diffcult questions at a later time.
